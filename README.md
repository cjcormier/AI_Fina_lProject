#Overview

This is the final project of CS4341 Intro to Artificial Intelligence at Worcester 
Polytechnic Institute. 

This project attempts to create an AI for the board game "Secret Hitler". Secret Hitler 
is a game where about half the players are secretly Fascists that are attempting to take 
control of the government by enacting fasist policies. The full rules
for the game can be found on their 
[website](http://secrethitler.com/assets/Secret_Hitler_Rules.pdf).

The bulk of this project is to determine a strategy for the liberals to determine who the 
fasists are to prevent a fasist government. A more detailed analysis of the project can be 
found on the report branch under the report directory, or 
[here](https://github.com/cjcormier/AI_Final_Project/tree/Report/Report).
